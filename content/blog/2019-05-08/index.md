description: Clean Code, a book recommended to me
---

I met with another company for an interview yesterday. I thought it went well. The Solutions Architect seemed indeed well versed in good coding practices and knowledgable. I like the company.

He recommended a book by Robert C. Martin, "Clean Code." So, I downloaded it. It's about 450 pages and I'm not exactly rolling in spare time, but I started it and it's a good read.

##### A phone call

Wow, I now have a third interview. That was fast. I'm excited to see how this goes. I thought this would take weeks. This company (I'll leave names out for now) is one that I look up to. I am sure it will go well. Even if I don't get an offer, it's great interview experience. But this I where I get a bit nervous wondering if they go with another candidate, will they interview me again when I have more experience?

They should just hire me and spare us the worry!
