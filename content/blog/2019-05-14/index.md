description: The development industry doesn't care what language you like

I've been holding to my studies and write in Java (and JS) daily. Since my Oracle exam is first, I feel like this takes priority. However, I need to work. I've managed to qualify for finacial aid for school and continued studies, but I need to be out there working in development. I don't care if it's even an internship. I'm just as interested in C# as I am Java, and I love the new React/Angular front ends. But, I need to be _working_ in them.

##### Over qualified and under qualified

It's like something out of a bad story. When job searching, I come in with 4 years of production experience, but not _specifically_ in Java or C#, even though I do know the languages. The technical exams and questions aren't a problem. I'm more than willing to take them. I'm more than willing to put in the work, but it seems employers want the "perfect" candidate. Is age a factor here?

The next 6 months are going to be a blur. I'll be studying constantly and working (if possible, I'm starting to wonder if I am missing something here) if not on the job then I'll enhance my contributions to projects. I'm a team of one right now. Making contacts if you're not part of the cliques I see at every meetup, well, then it's just hit or miss.

It has been recommended I don't take the advanced C# class with my Java II in the Fall because they are "project based." Okay, so? I am considering adding advanced C# to my Fall workload, especially if this whole (seriously depressing and frustrating) work situation doesn't remedy itself.

I'm getting frustrated with the cliques and in-crowd. I am not the most talkative of people when I don't know you. I say something when something is relevant and appropriate. I'm not real fond of large crowds. The IT atmosphere here seems only welcoming if you know the others in it. I am putting in the time and effort to integrate and getting no where. Hopefully with time this changes. If I wasn't a single father of 5 with full-custody, I would move, but that's just not in the cards right now. In the future that might change.

##### Update

One phone call just changed ... everything.
