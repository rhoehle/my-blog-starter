Well, it looks like  all the funding I requested came through.  A lot of it loans, but at least I can defer them until I graduate and am working somewhere.  Hopefully all of this only takes 2 semesters, but I can see it going into three, especially if I want my formal C# deverloper certification, and I would like to take some more JavaScript too.

I got the acceptance last night.  Yay!  HI-5! *who?*  With all my seclusion I've kinda let my social life... kinda?  I have no social life.  I study, take care of my kids, workout, study, sleep, repeat.  Once this first semester is over, hopefully I can at least relax a little.  I am a single father.  I enjoy female company, and miss it, but that takes time and some resources.  Both of which I'm in short supply of.  My friends, what friends.  I don't have time, and have pushed most of them away by not giving them the time they deserve.  I guess that's part of the sacrifice?  I'll worry about that some other day.  But, frustrating isn't the word I'm looking for.

Looks like I got some grants and they are reviewing my scholarship information for Fall term.  Be nice to land a scholarship.  I couldn't believe I got the grants.  I'm actually quite excited.  This should enable me to study full-time over the summer (with some side work) and I'll look at landing an intership since I'm now officially a student again.  Hopefully, that will blossom into a career when I graduate.  That's the hope anyway.

Anyway, I am indeed stoked for the award.
