description: A job, school, and a surprise
---
I had almost forgotten just how crazy college was.  Almost.  This last week I started classes in an effort to bring my Java development skills up to an acceptable level to work in the area.  The week I started school I was also offered a position with a software development company ... which completely took me off-guard.  

##### What to do?
Take the job of course.  I still have to iron out the details and accept the final offer, but it looks to be a go.  I am a bit leary this is too quick to take a position, but this is a great opportunity to get some traction in my area of expertise.  However, there is no way I can do Dmacc full-time and work full-time, so I'll have to drop a couple of courses.  Funding... I'm not sure how to juggle yet, I have to go in and talk to the advisor again.
