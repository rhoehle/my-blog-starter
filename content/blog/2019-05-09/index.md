##### Writing code by 6:30am

I've been doing various code classes, (freeCodeCamp()), projects, changing my own web site, and preparing to head back to school daily now for a few weeks.  I look forward to it daily and learn daily.  I think I'll have to break this out into a schedule so I can cover all the subjects and prepare for the Oracle exam as a priority.  It's almost impossible to constantly study just Java all day.  I seem to get more out of it if I break it out into sessions.

##### Oracle Exam for 2 hours, freeCodeCamp() for 2 hours, Web site work 2 hours (front or backend), then whatever needs attention for 2 hours.

I figure while I'm prepping for the Oracle exam and only working on upgrading my skillset (and some freelance stuff), I'll keep to an eight hour day just like a work day.

##### Night study for 2 to 3 hours
	
If I don't have a meetup, I'll work in another 2 to 3 hours to blog and finish with more Oracle study or reading.  This blog is meant to bring up my writing skills which have deterioriated, but are still somewhat relevant and continually refactor my habits for success.

##### Interview today

Interview today seemed to go well, but I could almost hear them thinking, "but you don't have enough Java production experience".... sigh.  Perhaps not, but I have experience, and I can write in Java.  I think I'm quite adept at it.  Still honing my TDD skills for it however.  Trying out different starter projects to *start* writing in test then write the code.  Also have been dabbling in different scripts to get things started.
