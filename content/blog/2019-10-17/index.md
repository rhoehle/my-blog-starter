#####New role as a software engineer
I was given the job in May, started in June and then decided to get married...

#####Married
Yeah! It's great. Erin is her name, she's great. And going to get greater, as in great bigger with baby.

#####New home
We bought a house in August. Still moving in... go figure.

#####Dmacc
Started Dmacc in the Summer. It's been great, but I was given an opportunity to work as an engineer immediately (I have previous experience) and I'm having trouble keeping up. It's not the content... I do not have the time. I've figured out I can go 2 days with 4 hours sleep a night before it starts adversely affecting me. I was doing as little as 3 hours, and started dreaming while writing code... yeah, need more sleep. I prefer 8 hours.

#####Pregnant
Wowsa. That was about a year before I was ready, but it's all good... just pile it on. Oh, were having a boy! So, Erin and I have one girl (3 y/o) and one boy in March (and I have 4 other kids we blended in).

######As I said
ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!! I'm going kind of nuts.
