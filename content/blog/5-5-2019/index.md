description: A long day of coding
---

I have been writing Java and C# all weekend. I took some time away to work-out and be with my kids, but other than that, I was diligently studying and writing code. The flow is coming back nicely I must say. It took awhile to get my IDE's (InteliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code) working the way I wanted to about a month ago, but now I am again fluent in them and find myself running all 3 with ease and publishing to the web.

## A long road?

I originally hoped I could get away with just a semester of college and taking the Oracle Java SE 8 exam, but now I see that I'll have to take Summer courses and all of Fall to complete the certifications. When all is said and done I should be indeed an expert (or close to one) in Java and C#, and hopefully Angular/React too.

- What does it say when you have to pause a moment to think about how old you are?
