I've decided to return to school to get back to where I started, Java and .Net, and the web (mainly Java script--React, Angular, NodeJS). I moved on from my last employer in an effort to get back into the mainstream coding world. Although much of my work was done moving code into a .Net container, it was usually accomplished using Lansa or SQL to move the U/I and logic into a modern Windows environment.

## Java Application Developer

After I complete my course work I'll have my certification as a Java Application Developer from Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC). I'll also be taking some C# and Javascript (JS) while I'm there. Even though I have over 4 years of software development in me, I feel I need to get more current with Java (Java 12 now too), .Net, and the new front-end development tools. Most employers expect you to be able to use these coming into the position. So, I made this blog using React tools (JS) and will continue to produce work in Java Spring Boot, ASP.Net, and JS as I go along. I thought it would be a good idea to document my progress via a blog in an effort to force me to track my learning and possibly help others that might be in the same area as myself. I have made several databases that I will load with all the videos and learning materials I use and create some data queries for people to use. And, I'll link to anything I feel is relevant.
