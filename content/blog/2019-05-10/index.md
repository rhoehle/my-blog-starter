title: Be a better Java Developer

description: Learning non-stop

I made a schedule (see last blog post) and I try to stick to it. The Oracle exam is at the forefront of things I have to study. I looked up the date I could take it next (side note, don't call Oracle unless you're good with interpretting Indian accents, I could only understand ~ 40% of what she was saying on the phone and gave up eventually figuring out a different solution) and that date is July 31st. Ackpfft, I was hoping for June 31st or beginning of July. I have gone through all the material already and I should be ready in a few weeks, but there is no test offering until July, oh well. I'll be even more ready.

##### My underlying focus to be better a better Java programmer: Learn Java 8, Spring Framework, Unit Testing (and TDD), API's and libraries, JVM workings, design patterns, DevOps tools, Kotlin, Microservices, and know the IDE better (IntelliJ, and Eclipse--I like IntelliJ better).

I'm focused on Java 8. From what I can see, 9 - 12 are not in production almost anywhere yet. Trying not to shrug this off and learn 9, 10, 11, & 12, as I think this will become a focal point in the future, but there is only so much I can do.

Spring Boot is a big area. I'm trying to come up with some projects I could put on my website for all the differnt goals OR a mobile app, but a project I can use/keep.

TDD. Wow, this is huge. I need to come up with a way to create a project that starts with making Tests first. I've thought about making a script, but that seems inefficient. Any larger project I make the src folder and name the Class, then make a test folder and write tests to the Class I created for testing first. I just can't seem to make this work for all the smaller projects. I would think another developer or teacher would have thought of something, perhaps a plugin, perhaps I should write a plugin... I'll look into it. But, I'm guessing the smaller code blocks (like in a learning setting where you are creating methods/classes on the fly to teach your development ideas) just should be left alone. But anything else! Even the small assignments... TDD!

API's libraries, and the JVM I try to incorporate as much as possible. API's come naturally if you are creative in your progam project decisions.

Design patterns: I need to study the main ones. Perhaps I'll pick up the "Gang of Four Design Patterns" Seems to be a good reference.

DevOps. Why do I feel this is more of a buzzword? I love the idea, I really do, but honestly, it just seems like common sense by leveraging Agile. I've been a lone developer before, and being isolated sucks, period. If there are devs that like that? I do not believe you. Either that or you are not really isolated. I like working on a team, you learn more, you create better code, you FEEL BETTER about yourself, and on and on. Nonetheless, I attend DevOps meetups and study it where I can.

Kotlin. I think I'll pick a project in Kotlin and give it a go. Thinking mobile.

Microservices. This ties into containers (Docker, Kubernetes), web services, AWS/Azure, and puts your name on the map quickly. I need to get a better handle on it.

I constantly refine my IDE skills, but often I get complacent with one way of doing things and don't think of a better way. Often the better way is by utilizing the IDE to accomplish a task.

Easy. Right?

I'm easily studying 10 hours a day right now. I am worried about burnout and need to create some projects that carry more meaning (ie, have some kind of return value -> a mobile app, or java app for Windows or a webservice running on one of my websites, something.
