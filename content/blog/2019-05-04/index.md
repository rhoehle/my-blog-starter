This is Saturday, 5-4-2019. Developing, coding, writing, thinking, fogetting to eat, running 5 monitors all with several web sessions running and 3 IDE's(_are both my eyes pointing in the same direction still?_) and often much more is a what any typical moment is like for me.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

I've been doing a lot of TDD lately. Once you develop the muscle memory to write the tests first, it is a great way to develop. But, training that muscle memory reminds me of when Rocky had his left arm tied to his said and Micky was screaming at him to punch the bag with his right and Rock complains, "Can't I just use my other arm?"  
I often start a project and I've already decided what problems I'm going to address first, and I'll throw them into the IDE first and start developing.
Now, I'm trying to put them in as comments then write the tests, then write the methods. In the end, you have a better program, but it feels like throwing a punch or a ball with your off-hand at first.
